# Project Overview
This project aims to build a chatbot by leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models and techniques. The primary steps involved in this project include preparing a dataset, loading the FLAN-T5 model, tokenization, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and training the model.

# Keywords and Main Features
# Preparing the Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 250 emails collected from various open-source datasets and AI chatbots. This diverse collection of emails ensures that the chatbot is trained on a wide range of conversational data, making it more versatile and capable of handling different types of queries.

# Loading the FLAN-T5 Model
We utilize the FLAN-T5 model, a powerful text-to-text transformer model developed by Google. The FLAN-T5 model is well-suited for a variety of NLP tasks and provides a strong foundation for building a high-performance chatbot.

# Tokenization
Tokenization is a crucial step in the preprocessing pipeline. In this project, we employ efficient tokenization techniques to convert the text data into a format that the FLAN-T5 model can process. Proper tokenization ensures that the model can accurately interpret and respond to user inputs.

# Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is used to fine-tune the FLAN-T5 model with a smaller number of parameters. By applying LoRA, we can efficiently adapt the pre-trained model to our specific dataset without requiring extensive computational resources.

# Training
The training phase involves fine-tuning the FLAN-T5 model using the prepared dataset and the LoRA method. This step optimizes the model's performance, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses in a conversational setting.
